- Generate a pair of keys:
```bash
    openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 2048
```
- Make certificate:
```bash
    openssl req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```
- Make another pair of keys:
```bash
    openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
```
- Sign certificate:
```bash
    openssl req -new -out server.csr -key server.key
```
- Verify certificate:
```bash
    openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 360
```
<hr/>
3: Make password file (in your mosquitto installation folder, e.g. <code>/etc/mosquitto/</code>):

```bash
    mosquitto_passwd -c passwd.conf server
```
<hr/>
4: Modify mosquitto.conf file. Append this lines to it:

```code
    allow_anonymous false
    password_file           //path to passwd.conf which you had made in section 3//
    port 8883
    cafile                  //path to ca.crt which you had made in section 2//
    certfile                //path to server.crt which you had made in section 2//
    keyfile                 //path to server.key which you had made in section 2//
